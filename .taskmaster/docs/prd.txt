# RSS AI Processing Pipeline Enhancement - PRD

## Product Overview
Enhance the AI Discrimination Monitor v2's RSS processing pipeline with comprehensive background AI classification, queue management, and real-time status monitoring. The current system processes 88 RSS feeds but 70 have never been fetched, and AI classification lacks queue management and retry mechanisms.

## Problem Statement
The current RSS processing system has several critical limitations:
1. **No Queue Management**: AI classification happens immediately during RSS processing, causing timeouts and failures
2. **70 Unprocessed Feeds**: 79% of feeds have never been fetched due to processing bottlenecks
3. **Limited Retry Logic**: Failed AI classifications are not retried automatically
4. **Poor Visibility**: No real-time monitoring of AI processing status
5. **API Inefficiency**: Individual API calls for each article instead of batching
6. **Background Processing Issues**: Current setTimeout approach is unreliable for high volume

## Target Users
- **System Administrators**: Need visibility into AI processing queue and error handling
- **Content Managers**: Require reliable AI classification for editorial workflows
- **Data Analysts**: Need accurate AI classifications for discrimination trend analysis
- **API Consumers**: Expect consistent article classifications and processing status

## Core Features

### 1. AI Processing Queue System
**Priority: HIGH**
- Persistent queue for AI classification tasks with priority levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed classifications
- Rate limiting to respect AI provider API limits (OpenAI: 10,000 requests/day, Anthropic: 5,000 requests/day)
- Batch processing to optimize API calls (process 5-10 articles per API call)
- Queue depth monitoring with alerts when backlog exceeds 1,000 articles

### 2. Enhanced Status Monitoring Dashboard
**Priority: HIGH**
- Real-time AI processing dashboard showing queue metrics (pending/processing/completed/failed)
- Processing speed metrics (articles/hour, average processing time, success rate)
- Error analysis dashboard with classification failure reasons and retry status
- Recent activity timeline with detailed processing logs
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for live monitoring

### 3. Background Worker Process
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Dedicated background worker for continuous AI processing
- Automatic queue processing with configurable batch sizes
- Health checks and automatic restart logic for reliability
- Worker start/stop controls in admin interface
- Integration with RSS processor to auto-queue new articles

### 4. Admin Control Interface
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Queue management controls (pause/resume processing)
- Bulk operations for reprocessing failed classifications
- Priority adjustment for urgent articles
- Manual retry mechanisms for specific articles
- Performance tuning controls (batch size, processing intervals)

### 5. Bulk Processing for Backlog
**Priority: HIGH**
- Process all 70 never-fetched feeds with AI classification
- Bulk reprocessing functionality for articles with failed/outdated classifications
- Progress tracking for bulk operations with completion estimates
- Ability to process specific feed batches to avoid system overload

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Enhancements
- New ProcessingQueue table with priority, status, and retry tracking
- Enhanced ProcessingLog with queue-specific event types
- Indexes for efficient queue processing queries
- Cleanup mechanisms for old processing logs

### API Enhancements
- POST `/api/ai-queue/process` - Trigger queue processing
- GET `/api/ai-queue/status` - Queue metrics and status
- POST `/api/ai-queue/retry` - Retry failed classifications
- POST `/api/ai-queue/bulk-add` - Add multiple articles to queue
- GET `/api/background/ai-worker/status` - Background worker status

### Performance Requirements
- Process 200+ articles/hour (4x current speed)
- 70% reduction in API calls through batching
- <5% failed classification rate (with retry)
- 95% of articles classified within 24 hours
- <100ms average database query response time

### Integration Requirements
- RSS processor automatically queues new articles for AI classification
- Failed RSS fetches trigger individual feed processing
- Admin dashboard integrated with existing RSS monitoring
- Real-time updates without impacting user-facing performance

## User Stories

### Admin User Stories
1. **As an admin**, I want to see real-time AI processing queue status so I can monitor system health
2. **As an admin**, I want to retry failed AI classifications so I can ensure complete data coverage
3. **As an admin**, I want to process the 70 never-fetched feeds so all data is properly classified
4. **As an admin**, I want to control background processing so I can manage system resources
5. **As an admin**, I want to see error analysis so I can identify and fix processing issues

### System User Stories
1. **As a system**, I want to automatically queue new articles so AI classification happens reliably
2. **As a system**, I want to retry failed classifications so data quality is maintained
3. **As a system**, I want to batch API calls so I stay within provider limits
4. **As a system**, I want to monitor queue depth so I can alert on processing backlogs

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: 200+ articles processed per hour
- **API Efficiency**: Reduce API calls by 70% through batching
- **Error Recovery**: 90% of failed classifications recovered via retry
- **Queue Processing**: 95% of queued articles processed within 24 hours

### Operational Metrics
- **Backlog Processing**: Successfully process all 70 never-fetched feeds
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% background processing uptime
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss during queue processing
