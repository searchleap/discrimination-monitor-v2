# Serverless Persistence Simulation for AI Article Processing

## Product Requirements Document
**Project**: Discrimination Monitor v2 - Serverless Queue Persistence
**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Planning

## Executive Summary
Implement automated AI article processing that mimics persistent background workers in Vercel's serverless environment, ensuring continuous queue processing without manual intervention.

## Objective
Create a system that automatically processes pending articles in the processing queue without requiring manual "Process Queue Now" button clicks, while working within Vercel's serverless constraints.

## Current State
- **Working System**: Manual processing works perfectly (100% success rate on 91 articles)
- **Architecture**: Serverless batch processor handling 5 articles per execution
- **Problem**: No automation - requires manual trigger for each batch
- **Queue Status**: 141 pending articles awaiting processing

## Target Architecture
Design multiple automation approaches that can work independently or together:

1. **Vercel Cron Jobs** - Scheduled automatic processing
2. **Function Chaining** - Self-triggering functions that continue until queue empty
3. **Client-Side Automation** - Browser-based polling and auto-triggering
4. **Webhook Integration** - RSS feed updates trigger processing
5. **Database Triggers** - Queue changes trigger processing functions

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Queue Processing**: System should detect pending articles and process them
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: Should work without admin dashboard interaction
- **Batch Processing**: Maintain 5-article batches for optimal performance
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures gracefully and retry
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize function executions while maintaining responsiveness

### Performance Requirements
- **Processing Latency**: Start processing within 5 minutes of articles being queued
- **Throughput**: Process all pending articles within 1 hour during normal load
- **Reliability**: 99%+ success rate for automated processing
- **Resource Efficiency**: Stay within Vercel function limits

### Integration Requirements
- **Existing API Compatibility**: Don't break current manual processing
- **Database Consistency**: Maintain ACID properties during automated processing
- **Monitoring**: Provide visibility into automated processing status
- **Configuration**: Allow enabling/disabling automation features

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Vercel Cron Jobs
**Description**: Use Vercel's built-in cron job functionality for scheduled processing
**Frequency**: Every 15 minutes during business hours, hourly otherwise
**Benefits**: Native Vercel integration, reliable scheduling
**Drawbacks**: Fixed intervals, not responsive to queue changes

### Approach 2: Self-Chaining Functions
**Description**: Functions that trigger themselves recursively until queue is empty
**Mechanism**: After processing batch, check for more articles and re-trigger if found
**Benefits**: Responsive to queue state, processes until complete
**Drawbacks**: Complex error handling, potential infinite loops

### Approach 3: Client-Side Automation
**Description**: Admin dashboard automatically triggers processing when queue detected
**Mechanism**: React hooks poll queue status and trigger processing
**Benefits**: Real-time responsiveness, user visibility
**Drawbacks**: Requires admin dashboard to be open

### Approach 4: Webhook Chain Integration
**Description**: RSS feed updates trigger immediate processing
**Mechanism**: Feed updates → article ingestion → automatic AI processing
**Benefits**: Immediate processing of new content
**Drawbacks**: Dependent on external webhook reliability

### Approach 5: Database-Driven Triggers
**Description**: Database events trigger serverless functions
**Mechanism**: Neon database triggers or change streams
**Benefits**: True event-driven architecture
**Drawbacks**: Complex setup, potential vendor lock-in

## User Stories

### As an Administrator
- I want articles to be automatically processed without manual intervention
- I want to configure automation settings (frequency, batch size, error handling)
- I want to monitor automation status and performance metrics
- I want the ability to disable automation and fall back to manual processing

### As a System
- I want to detect pending articles and process them automatically
- I want to handle processing failures gracefully with retry logic  
- I want to optimize processing timing to balance cost and responsiveness
- I want to maintain processing logs for debugging and analytics

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Automated Processing**: System processes pending articles without manual trigger
2. **Queue Monitoring**: System detects when new articles are added to queue
3. **Batch Processing**: Maintains current 5-article batch processing logic
4. **Error Handling**: Failed batches are retried with exponential backoff
5. **Configuration**: Automation can be enabled/disabled via admin interface

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: All pending articles processed within 1 hour
2. **Reliability**: 99%+ automated processing success rate
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize unnecessary function executions
4. **Monitoring**: Processing status visible in admin dashboard
5. **Fallback**: Manual processing remains available if automation fails

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Infinite Loops**: Self-chaining functions could create runaway executions
- **Rate Limits**: Too frequent processing could hit API limits
- **Cost Overruns**: Excessive automation could increase Vercel costs

### Medium Risk
- **Processing Delays**: Cron-based approach might delay processing
- **Error Propagation**: Failures in automated chain could stop all processing
- **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple automation options could confuse users

### Low Risk
- **Database Load**: Current processing load is well within database limits
- **Function Timeouts**: Current processing times are well under limits
- **UI Complexity**: Automation settings can be hidden in advanced configuration

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Vercel Cron Jobs (Low Risk, High Value)
- Implement scheduled processing every 15 minutes
- Add admin configuration for cron frequency
- Monitor and optimize scheduling intervals

### Phase 2: Self-Chaining Functions (Medium Risk, High Value)  
- Implement recursive function triggering
- Add safeguards against infinite loops
- Implement exponential backoff for errors

### Phase 3: Client-Side Automation (Low Risk, Medium Value)
- Add auto-polling to admin dashboard
- Implement smart triggering based on queue state
- Add user controls for automation settings

### Phase 4: Advanced Integration (High Risk, High Value)
- Implement webhook-triggered processing
- Add database change stream monitoring
- Create unified automation orchestration

## Success Metrics
- **Automation Rate**: % of articles processed without manual intervention
- **Processing Latency**: Average time from article queued to processed
- **Error Rate**: % of automated processing attempts that fail
- **Cost Efficiency**: Function execution cost per article processed
- **User Satisfaction**: Admin feedback on automation reliability
