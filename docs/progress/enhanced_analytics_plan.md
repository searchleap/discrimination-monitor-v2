# Enhanced Analytics Dashboard - Implementation Roadmap

## Objective
Expand the current basic charts into a comprehensive analytics dashboard that provides deep insights into discrimination patterns, geographic trends, AI performance, and actionable intelligence for monitoring bias in AI systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Geographic Intelligence
- [ ] Interactive world/country heat map showing incident density
- [ ] Geographic clustering analysis with zoom levels
- [ ] Location-based trend comparisons
- [ ] Export geographic data as JSON/CSV

### Phase 2: Advanced Time Series Analysis  
- [ ] Multi-dimensional time series (category + severity + location)
- [ ] Period-over-period comparison widgets (YoY, MoM)
- [ ] Seasonal pattern detection and forecasting
- [ ] Custom date range picker with presets

### Phase 3: Deep Drill-Down Analysis
- [ ] Click-through from charts to filtered article views
- [ ] Multi-level filtering (cascade filters)
- [ ] Correlation analysis between variables
- [ ] Statistical significance indicators

### Phase 4: AI Performance Analytics
- [ ] Classification confidence distribution analysis
- [ ] AI provider performance comparison (OpenAI vs Anthropic vs Fallback)
- [ ] Processing time and error rate tracking
- [ ] Model accuracy trending over time

### Phase 5: Export & Reporting
- [ ] PDF report generation with key insights
- [ ] Scheduled report delivery system
- [ ] Data export in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- [ ] Embeddable charts for external use

## Technical Architecture

### New Components to Build
```
src/components/analytics/
├── GeographicHeatMap.tsx          # Interactive world map
├── AdvancedTimeSeriesChart.tsx    # Multi-dimensional time analysis  
├── DrillDownModal.tsx             # Detailed view with filters
├── ComparisonWidget.tsx           # Period-over-period analysis
├── CorrelationMatrix.tsx          # Statistical relationships
├── AIPerformancePanel.tsx         # AI classification analytics
├── ExportManager.tsx              # Report generation interface
└── FilterPanel.tsx                # Advanced multi-dimensional filters
```

### New API Endpoints
```
src/app/api/analytics/
├── geographic/route.ts            # Geographic aggregation data
├── correlations/route.ts          # Statistical relationship analysis  
├── ai-performance/route.ts        # AI classification metrics
├── export/route.ts                # Data export functionality
└── reports/route.ts               # PDF report generation
```

### Database Schema Extensions
- Add indexes for analytics performance
- Create materialized views for complex aggregations
- Add analytics caching layer

### Libraries to Add
- `react-simple-maps` - Geographic visualizations
- `d3-geo` - Geographic projections and clustering
- `jspdf` - PDF report generation
- `recharts-pro` - Advanced chart types
- `date-fns-tz` - Timezone handling for global data

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Geographic Data Quality**: Current location data may be inconsistent
  - *Mitigation*: Implement location standardization and geocoding
- **Performance with Large Datasets**: Complex analytics may be slow
  - *Mitigation*: Implement caching and pagination

### Medium Risk  
- **Chart Library Limitations**: Recharts may not handle all use cases
  - *Mitigation*: Evaluate D3.js integration for custom components
- **Export File Size**: Large datasets may cause memory issues
  - *Mitigation*: Stream processing and chunked downloads

### Low Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: Advanced charts may not work on older browsers
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement with fallbacks

## Test Hooks

### Unit Tests
- Geographic data processing functions
- Statistical calculation accuracy
- Date range filtering logic
- Export functionality

### Integration Tests  
- API endpoint performance with large datasets
- Chart rendering with various data shapes
- Filter cascade behavior
- Report generation pipeline

### E2E Tests
- Full analytics workflow from data load to export
- Interactive chart behavior (click, hover, zoom)
- Multi-filter application and reset
- PDF report download and content validation

## Performance Targets

### API Response Times
- Geographic data: < 500ms
- Time series data: < 300ms  
- Correlation analysis: < 1s
- PDF generation: < 3s

### Client-Side Performance
- Chart render time: < 200ms
- Filter application: < 100ms
- Export preparation: < 1s

### Data Limits
- Support up to 10K articles without pagination
- Geographic clustering for > 1K locations
- Real-time updates for datasets < 1K articles

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with Geographic Heat Map** - High visual impact
2. **Advanced Time Series** - Builds on existing charts  
3. **AI Performance Analytics** - Uses existing AI data
4. **Drill-Down and Correlation** - Adds interactivity
5. **Export and Reporting** - Completes the feature set

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Time spent on analytics page > 2 minutes
- Charts interacted with per session > 5
- Export feature usage > 10% of analytics visitors

### Technical Performance
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Zero chart rendering errors
- 95% successful export operations

### Business Value
- Identification of actionable bias patterns
