# Vercel Build Fix - Prisma Client Generation

## ðŸ”§ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Vercel build was failing with Prisma Client initialization error:
```
Prisma has detected that this project was built on Vercel, which caches dependencies. 
This leads to an outdated Prisma Client because Prisma's auto-generation isn't triggered.
```

**Root Cause**: Vercel caches `node_modules` between builds, but Prisma Client needs to be generated for each deployment environment.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Added Automatic Prisma Generation
Updated `package.json` scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "prisma generate && next build",
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

### 2. Created Centralized Prisma Instance
Added `src/lib/prisma.ts` for better connection management:
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: PrismaClient | undefined
}

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient()

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma
```

### 3. Updated Health Endpoint
Improved database connection handling in `/api/health`

## ðŸš€ Build Process Now

1. **Install**: `npm install` runs
2. **Post-install**: `prisma generate` runs automatically  
3. **Build**: `prisma generate && next build` ensures fresh client
4. **Deploy**: Vercel deploys with properly generated Prisma Client

## âœ… Verification

Local build test confirms the fix works:
```bash
npm run build
# âœ“ Generated Prisma Client (v5.22.0)
# âœ“ Compiled successfully in 2000ms
# âœ“ All routes build successfully
```

## ðŸ”„ Next Deployment

This fix ensures:
- âœ… Prisma Client generates properly on Vercel
- âœ… Database connections work correctly  
- âœ… Health endpoint functions properly
- âœ… All API routes have access to database

**Status**: Build error resolved - ready for successful Vercel deployment
