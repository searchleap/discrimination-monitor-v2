# ‚úÖ Articles Display Fixed - Real Data Now Showing

## üéØ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Dashboard was showing synthetic/mock articles instead of real RSS-processed articles
**Root Cause**: ArticleGrid component was using hardcoded mock data instead of fetching from API
**Solution**: Updated component to fetch real articles from `/api/articles` endpoint

## üîç Investigation Results

### What We Found:
1. **Database**: ‚úÖ Contains 49 real articles from EFF RSS processing
2. **API Endpoint**: ‚úÖ `/api/articles` returns real articles correctly
3. **Dashboard Component**: ‚ùå Was using hardcoded mock articles with `example.com` URLs
4. **Data Quality**: ‚úÖ Real articles have legitimate URLs and recent content

### Mock vs. Real Articles:
**Before (Mock)**:
- "AI Hiring Tool Shows Bias Against Disability Applicants in Michigan"
- URL: `https://example.com/article1`  
- Date: Future dates (2025-01-08)

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes Applied

### Updated ArticleGrid Component:
1. **Added API Fetching**:

   const data = await response.json()
   ```

2. **Enhanced Data Structure**:
   - Added proper TypeScript interface for Article
   - Support for both real and mock articles
   - Handle API response structure

3. **Improved User Experience**:
